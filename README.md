# ChatApp

The chat app is a real-time communication tool that allows users to send and receive messages over the internet. It was developed using the Java 
programming language and the JavaFX library, which was used to build the app's graphical user interface (GUI). The GUI allows users to see a list of online 
users and send and receive messages to and from them.

To enable communication between users, the app includes network programming, which allows it to send and receive data over the internet. The app also uses 
multi-threading to enable multiple conversations to occur simultaneously, allowing users to engage in multiple chats at the same time.

To ensure the app is fully functional and ready for use, it was thoroughly tested and debugged. This involved identifying and fixing any issues or bugs 
that were discovered during the development process. Overall, the chat app is a reliable and user-friendly tool for real-time communication.
